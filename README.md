# JumpingSumo

In this project, I trained a Jumping Sumo by parrot to navigate around a circular track using a neural network. This is the android component which was used to collect the training data (image, previous turn and speed values) at regular intervals as well as issue commands to the drone after training.

The training was done in a separate java project and the relevant files can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/frankibem/ba5165c1684aa525102b439222156434).

A description of the process/methodology can also be found [here](https://frankanya.wordpress.com/2016/08/27/jumping-sumo-introduction/)
